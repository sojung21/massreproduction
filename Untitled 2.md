a coincidence that both field evaporation and mass spectrometer requires a charge?

how does other software deal with presenting a bar from one with noise

detection efficiency limited by MCP detector which takes up to 40% and its size

could i bold/italicize words?

Regardless of whether one or several ions arrive in that detection window, 
The 

In atom probe, main known sources of noise are residual gas contamination and electrical detector inefficiencies. Residual gas particles from the chamber or adsorbed to the surface of the sample can be ionised and arrive at any time in the experiment [Miller]. Its random nature, however, must be explained by detailing the method of the time of flight analyser. The TOF analysis method requires that a ‘detection window’ is specified, that is, the duration after the event of a pulse in which a detected ion is attributed to evaporation by that pulse. The time of the pulse, therefore, marks the beginning of its time of flight (Figure 2.2d). Any ion therefore, that arrives during the detection window, is recorded on the mass spectrum. This is acceptable for those ions that were indeed evaporated by the preceding pulse, however, residual gas ions that may have , In addition to this, ions of an unexpected high mass can appear in the background as a broad peak with a low mass-to-charge ratio, due to their particularly long flight time that impacts in the subsequent detection window,

Background noise can be caused by a range of set-up specific inefficiencies including residual gas contamination and electrical interference, and are often treated by simply removing data below a cut-off criterion, typically the average background noise level across the spectrum. Modern purpose-built mass spectrometers are purported to have backgrounds of almost zero noise []. Peak widths, on the other hand, occur due to imperfections in the mass analyser
Peak width occurs because… In some mass spectrometers, a good quality result produces Gaussian or .. peak widths. The concept of mass resolution is intrinsically related to peak widths. In Figure #, it can be seen that a low resolution result shows one wide peak where in fact two peaks exist at higher resolution [].
A raw atom probe result is shown below. Peaks with a sharp leading edge and a wider trailing edge are evident, as well as background noise that is easier to inspect in a logarithmic scale. The shape of peaks is mainly attributed to the … In fact, … 
The following discussion, therefore, first characterises the shape of background and peaks generic of atom probe mass spectrometry, and explains the occurrence of these phenomena with relation to atom probe. Then, techniques to obtain the simplified mass-to-charge values are enumerated.
what are the typical issues for MS in atom probe
-	mass resolution – NO
-	background - NO
are they unique to atom probe
how do other MS deal with issues in common?
The atom probe is, in essence, a combination of a mass spectrometer and a field ion microscope.


Not certain where I should describe what a field ion microscope is. Maybe this is how I should define an atom probe at the start, and also explain field ion microscopy? Note for the start, also like to clarify the difference between atomic force microscopy and atom probe microscopy which is commonly confused
